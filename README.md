# Weather-Dashboard

## Description

This is a very simple Weather-Dashboard I made to better understand css elements with having different "boxes" and for using a server side api.
I learned if you don't have your key set up correctly you can go crazy thinking you have your displays set up wrong.

## Installation

Just clone the code and it should work.

## Usage

Use the code for whatever you want.
